        <div class="article">
          <p>
	The phrase &quot;Muncie and comics&quot; usually brings up images of a fat, lazy cat with a love for lasagna, but probably not four guys sitting at a table, rolling an eight-sided die. However, that scene is popular in Ball State almnus Jolly Blackburn&#39;s comic strip, &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	The comic centers on the adventures of a role-playing group that regularly meets to play a game similar to &quot;Dungeons and Dragons.&quot; Immortalized in the longest running gaming magazine of the same name, KODT is set in a fictionalized version of Muncie.
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn attended Ball State in the late 70s and studied anthropology. References to the network of steam tunnels underneath the college as well as trips to the local Village Pantry heavily pepper the pages of his magazine.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Originally, it was a nod and a wink wink to my friends and old players,&quot; he said. &quot;In many ways, the Muncie of KODT is greatly exaggerated. But all of the locales and most of the characters in the strips were inspired by memories of real people and places.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	The character of B.A., the long-suffering game master of the &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; bears similarities to Blackburn himself. The only female in the gang, Sarah Felton is based off Blackburn&#39;s wife, Barbara.
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn recalls having no inkling of his future career path while attending Ball State. His love for writing manifested itself as a mere hobby, and he limited his comedic doodles to the margins of his history notes.
</p>
<p>
He found the white box in a corner of a now nonexistent off campus craft store called Bead Bazaar. The words &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; were scrawled across its surface.
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn&#39;s memory immediately jumped to a snowy day two years earlier in Studebaker West. Over long games of Risk and Monopoly, another student had regaled Blackburn and his friends with tales of adventure involving magic swords and dwarves. The description of the game had stuck. Now it was staring Blackburn in the face.
</p>
<div id="mobquote"><center><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/13858064465_99c98efcc5_n.jpg"><br>He had to have it.</center></div>
<p id="exception">
	He had to have it.
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn spent the entirety of the following summer within the confines of his dad&#39;s barbershop in Marion, Ind., building new worlds for his friends and their girlfriends.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;I loved the game because it gave me so many creative outlets. I was using my writing skills to come up with adventures, my meager drawing skills to come up with maps and character portraits,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p>
	Joel Bozell, a secretary for the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the inspiration for the KODT character of Brian Vanhoose played with Blackburn.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;We had a wonderful time together,&quot; said Bozell. &quot;We played for several years and just enjoyed the heck out of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	By 1989, Blackburn had enlisted in the army. His long suppressed talents threatened to send him into crisis mode.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;I knew if I didn&#39;t actively start pursuing my dreams and stop kicking them down the road, they&#39;d never happen,&quot; he said. &quot;To force myself to write on a regular basis, I decided I was going to do a small press magazine.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	He dubbed it Shadis, and soon he and his wife were shipping the bimonthly magazine to anybody who would read it. He said his experience with the Army influenced what he wrote.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;In the Army you tend to move frequently,&quot; he said. &quot;You establish friendships in an area, then you come down on orders and you are uprooted, picked up and dropped somewhere else in another part of the world. Gaming was our sanity. No matter what base we found ourselves on we knew we could find gamers who shared a love of tossing dice.&quot;
</p>

                <span class="caption">&quot;In the Army you tend to move frequently,&quot; Blackburn said. &quot;Gaming was our sanity.&quot;</span></center>
        </div>
                
<div class="article">
<p>
	KODT came into the picture while the second issue of Shadis was in the works.
</p>
<p>
	Needing something to fill a blank space on the book&#39;s last page, Blackburn penned a quick sketch of characters sitting around a table and playing a role-playing game.
</p>
<p>
	The third issue had the same dilemma and was solved with another sketch of the role-players.
</p>
<p>
	Quickly, people such as Gary Gygax, the co-creator of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons,&quot; were receiving copies of Shadis and taking notice of Blackburn&#39;s last second drawings.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;They were loving KODT and commenting more on it than the magazine itself,&quot; he said. &quot;And that&#39;s how KODT slowly took over the reigns of my life and began calling the shots.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn&#39;s old gaming friend Bozell was reading Shadis too.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;I saw the little strip and to be quite honest, I immediately dubbed it &#39;Beavis and Butthead Play Dungeons and Dragons,&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;You know, Jolly’s an okay artist; that’s not his strong point. His writing, well he’s the funniest man I have ever known in my life.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	As Blackburn’s strips evolved, Bozell began to recognize himself in the mannerisms of Brian, the comic&#39;s &quot;rules lawyer.&quot; He also noticed his friend Lew Herring in the high-strung temperament of Bob Herzog.
</p>

	&quot;I knew [Brian] was me long before he [Blackburn] admitted it,&quot; Bozell said. &quot;...I could argue down to the last bit of the sentence and where the period was whether it meant &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
	Bozell said he could not take credit for all of his fictional counterpart&#39;s characteristics.
</p>
<div id="mobquote">&quot;His writing, well [Blackburn is] the funniest man I have ever known in my life.&quot;</div>
<p>
	&quot;I was like the kernel and Brian’s now a tree,&quot; he said. &quot;The truth of it is that Jolly sort of took all the personality types, sort of mixed them in together, and sort of separated them out. He put a little bit of me here, a little bit of me there.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	In 1995, Blackburn sold Shadis. At its peak, up to 30,000 copies were printed per issue.
</p>
<p>
	A magazine owned by &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; called Dragon Magazine picked up the comic and expanded KODT&#39;s audience to five times the amount of people.
</p>
<p>
	In the fall of 1996, Kenzer and Company, a business that sells various role-playing and card games partnered with Blackburn to make KODT a monthly comic book.
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn became the vice president of Kenzer and Company as well as a major shareholder.
</p>
<p>
	Now, issues of KODT still make their way into the hands of readers each month. A live action version of the comic just received $69,525 from fans on Kickstarter. Its goal was $60,000.
</p>
<p>
	Bozell ties Blackburn&#39;s success to his ability to capture the gamer spirit.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;He is constantly getting people coming up to him at conventions and saying, &#39;Do you have a camera on my group,&#39;&quot; he said.
</p>
<p>
	Bozell still discusses decades old escapades he experienced with Blackburn and Herring with vivid detail and enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
	Blackburn&#39;s affection for &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; runs deep and in many directions, but he says the greatest appeal of the experience is its ability to nurture friendships. Whether the game is played in the rooms of a family business or on the property of a military base, there are always people to laugh with and to begin fantastical journeys.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;When I write, be it a comic strip or an editorial in the magazine, I always imagine I&#39m talking to those friends I&#39;ve tossed dice with,&quot; he said.
