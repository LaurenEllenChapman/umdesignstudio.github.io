<p>
Around President Jo Ann Gora&#39;s office, there is not a single picture of her husband, two children or three grandchildren.
</p>
<p  >
	Instead, the items that cover the walls and windowsills tell the story of a different family, a decade of Ball State history.
</p>
<p  >
	&ldquo;As I look around this office, I think it&#39;s a mess,&rdquo; Gora said. &ldquo;It&#39;s like I&#39;ve never thrown out anything that anyone has given me. It&#39;s like it has found a way to find itself on the windowsill.&rdquo;
</p>
<p  >
	Framed photos on the walls show Gora standing next to influential people who have come to campus, including Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. There&#39;s a hat from the Pride of Mid-America Marching Band, gifts from donors, a desk covered in paperwork and different awards on the windowsills and tables.
</p>
<p  >
	As she circles her office in the Administration Building Room 101, she points to each item and explains how she got it.
</p>
<p  >
	&ldquo;There&#39;s memories attached to all of these,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p  >
	The only personal item she brought with her a decade ago is a set of babushka dolls that sit on the windowsill. She bought them on the streets of Moscow in 1982, when she and a group of sociologists visited the city. They are painted to represent the leaders of the Soviet Union, &ldquo;down to Lenin.&rdquo;
</p>
<p  >
	She said her group was there talking about the relationship between risk and reward in capitalism â€” the idea that if a person is willing to take a risk, they can either win or lose everything.
</p>
<p  >
	During her time at Ball State, Gora has shown a tolerance for risk and has brought the institution some high rewards.
</p>
<p  >
	Since taking office, she launched the school&#39;s national marketing campaigns, Education Redefined and Education Redefined 2.0, helped raise millions for the university and reshape its landscape.
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	She oversaw two capital campaigns, the Bold campaign which raised more than $210 million and the recent athletic campaign that hopes to raise $20 million, as well as the beginning of immersive learning, now the trademark of a Ball State education.
</p>
<p  >
	But there have been bumps along the way.&nbsp;
