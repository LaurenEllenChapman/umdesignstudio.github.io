<p>
Around President Jo Ann Gora&#39;s office, there is not a single picture of her husband, two children or three grandchildren.
</p>
<p  >
	Instead, the items that cover the walls and windowsills tell the story of a different family, a decade of Ball State history.
</p>
<p  >
	&ldquo;As I look around this office, I think it&#39;s a mess,&rdquo; Gora said. &ldquo;It&#39;s like I&#39;ve never thrown out anything that anyone has given me. It&#39;s like it has found a way to find itself on the windowsill.&rdquo;
</p>
<p  >
	Framed photos on the walls show Gora standing next to influential people who have come to campus, including Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. There&#39;s a hat from the Pride of Mid-America Marching Band, gifts from donors, a desk covered in paperwork and different awards on the windowsills and tables.
</p>
<p  >
	As she circles her office in the Administration Building Room 101, she points to each item and explains how she got it.
</p>
<p  >
	&ldquo;There&#39;s memories attached to all of these,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p  >
	The only personal item she brought with her a decade ago is a set of babushka dolls that sit on the windowsill. She bought them on the streets of Moscow in 1982, when she and a group of sociologists visited the city. They are painted to represent the leaders of the Soviet Union, &ldquo;down to Lenin.&rdquo;
</p>
<p  >
	She said her group was there talking about the relationship between risk and reward in capitalism — the idea that if a person is willing to take a risk, they can either win or lose everything.
</p>
<p  >
	During her time at Ball State, Gora has shown a tolerance for risk and has brought the institution some high rewards.
</p>
<p  >
	Since taking office, she launched the school&#39;s national marketing campaigns, Education Redefined and Education Redefined 2.0, helped raise millions for the university and reshape its landscape.
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	She oversaw two capital campaigns, the Bold campaign which raised more than $210 million and the recent athletic campaign that hopes to raise $20 million, as well as the beginning of immersive learning, now the trademark of a Ball State education.
</p>
<p  >
	But there have been bumps along the way.&nbsp;
</p>

<p  >
	Lawmakers in 2011 questioned the rising cost of tuition at state institutions. Gora and other university presidents said falling support made the increases necessary. Ball State alone has lost more than $70 million in state funding, and Gora argued the university’s strengths deserved better. In the last funding cycle, the school received an increase in funding and the state also supplied the final $30 million in funding for the giant geothermal project.
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	“I felt very good about the last [legislative] session,” she said. “I also think we are positioned very well for the next session. All of the work that we have done to raise admission standards, to increase graduation rates: we will see the benefit of that in 2015 in that legislative session.”
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	In April, Gora met with four legislators to back up her statement that intelligent design is a religious theory, rather than a scientific one. Her statement in August was made in response to professor Eric Hedin being accused of teaching intelligent design in an honors colloquium.
</p>
<p  >
	“We will always answer the questions that people have, but to me this is very clear,” she said. “This is not an issue of free speech; this is an issue of academic integrity. Intelligent design should not be taught in science classes — it is a religious belief, it is not a scientific fact, and that is the position we’ve taken.”
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	In November, Gora took a stance against House Joint Resolution 3, a proposed ban on same-sex marriage in Indiana, for both moral and economic reasons. Her statement was released after the University Senate and the Student Government Association made statements against HJR-3.
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	“I think everybody understands that ... we all have a right, and in some cases an obligation, to say what we think is right and it’s important to do that,” Gora said. “I’m very comfortable with the position that we took. And I was very proud of the fact that the faculty wanted to state their position, the students stated their position, the staff stated their position.”
</p>
<p  >
	For her, true leadership is about long-term planning and considering what will help the institution in the long run, although she was concerned about how both these statements would affect the institution.
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	“We thought, is this going to alienate some prospective students who we would really like to recruit or families or whatever?” she said. “But, you know, you do what you think is right and you take the stance that you believe is right for the long term. And then you try to make sure that people understand your position and that you’re communicating it well and you move forward.”
</p>
<p  >
</p>
<p  >
	For Gora, it was her resolve and determination that got her through these changes.
</p>
<p  >
	“Any significant changes you want to make are rarely done easily, and they are rarely done with the enthusiastic applause of everyone,” she said. “So you have to have a certain level of confidence and resolve to ... [reach] that point where you say, ‘I hear what you are saying, but I still think we should move forward.’ And as it turns out, that has paid off for the institution.”
