	Real adulthood is approaching quickly, and whether you have a job or not, your days of absurd binge drinking are coming to an end. Your new adult drinking life requires less chugging, more sipping and a few ground rules.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Be an expert in something.</b> Start with flavors (albeit cheap) you know you like. If you can hammer 20 beers in a night, start taking trips to Savage’s and the Hoerot and trying the rotating drafts. Log your preferences and types of beer in an app like Untappd or read about them at beeradvocate.com. Or if you’re used to Southern Comfort, get familiar with a couple different levels of whiskey (try Bulleit or Eagle Rare) or take a trip to the Kentucky Bourbon trail to explore flavors. The more familiar you get with one type of drink, the more comfortable you’ll be ordering it and talking about it – which gives you the time to move on and explore other flavors.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Have a go-to, for appropriate locations.</b> You can’t order rum and coke at every single bar anymore. Alcohol is all about atmosphere, so know a few types of drinks for different types of locations. That means having a go-to liquor, mixed drink, domestic beer, local craft brew and a sense of where each of them belong.  For example, if you’re at an Irish pub, ask about the beers on draught. If you’re at a swanky club, get a fun cocktail with a type of liquor you know you tolerate well. If you’re totally lost, look at the menu for types of alcohol that appear often – that’s the bar’s specialty, so order that spirit or ask for a recommendation.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Ask for help.</b> If you have a beer-loving friend, ask him or her to sit down and walk you through the main types of beer. Learn to go by season – clearer, lighter beers in summer and darker beers in winter. Get familiar with your local brewers, big names like Sun King and Triton in Indianapolis or the beer from Muncie-born Scotty’s Brew House’s (Thr3e Wise Men.) If all else fails, order what someone else is having. There’s no shame in flattering their tastes while also developing yours.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Slow down, be professional.</b> Limit yourself on the number of drinks. Eat something beforehand. And no more flavored liquor or shots. Not in professional world. The journey ahead of you is about appreciating flavors like an adult, not experiencing an entire birthday’s worth of cake vodka in one night.  Oh, and one more tip: hold your drink in your left hand at events. That way, when you meet people, you’re extending a warm and not fumbling around and holding out a wet, damp fishy thing.
</p>
<p>
	Happy adult drinking!
</p>

				<h2>Drinking on the cheap</h2>
				<span style="color:#ffffff" class="byline">By Dominique Stewart | 72HRS</span>
				<p>
				Let’s face it, if you’re reading this you probably fit the typical college student M.O.: broke and loves booze. But that's a horrible combination if you’re trying to get your drink on.
				</p>
				<p>
				When you first turned 21, you probably thought it was OK to spend $20 at the bar, but the money is gone and the bills are stacking up.
				</p>
				<p>
				Forgo drinking at the bars and appreciate the art of the pre-game.
				</p>
				<h5>What is Pre-gaming?</h5>
				<p>
				The term pre-game is synonymous to the show that occurs before a live broadcast of any major sporting event, but it has become a term close to the hearts of many college students.
				</p>
				<p>
				Pre-gaming, as defined by Urban Dictionary, is the act of getting inebriated before going out—to either a party, social event or the bars—regardless if there will be alcohol provided.
				</p>
				<h5>The Art of the Pre-game</h5>
				<p>
				You know how you get when you’re drunk. You start making it rain on the bartender and for what? So you can have that one moment where everyone thinks you’re “the man or woman” for buying them shots? Trust me, you won’t be feeling invincible when AEP cuts your electricity.
				</p>

				<div class="secondarymobile">

					<h5>About the booze</h5>
					<p><b>On the cheap:</b> a handle of Jim Bean costs about $20</p>
					<p><b>Oh, you fancy:</b> a handle of Crown Royal costs about $49</p>
					<p><b>At the bars:</b> a shot of whiskey ranges from $7 to $8</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
				<b>Booze Run</b><br>
				You live in a college town. There are liquor stores everywhere. So embrace it and stock up on booze that will last you an entire month.
				</p>
				<p>
				Don’t waste your money on alcohol at the bars. It’s really not worth it. You’ll look like a drunk and that’s not a flattering image, even as a college student.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Bottoms Up</b><br>
				Whether you’re with a group or by yourself, start the night hard. No. I don’t mean take twenty shots of tequila that you become “that guy or gal” who is falling over before you even leave the house. But get yourself to the level you want to be for the rest of the night.
				</p>
				<p>
				If your level is tipsy and flirty or drunk and obnoxious, get there and make it work.
				</p>
				<p>
				The ultimate goal is to reach that level of drunkenness where you can throw your insecurities aside and have the time of your life, while still being able to act sober in front of the cops because ain’t nobody got time for getting a public intoxication ticket.
				</p>
				<p>
				And unless you’re planning on impressing someone by buying him or her a drink, you don’t need to be carrying your wallet. You might end up losing it anyway.
				</p>



				<h5>Ways to Pre-game</h5>
				<p>
				<b>Day drinking</b><br>
				Grab a beer once you get out of your last Friday class. It’s been a hell of a week and baby you deserve it. R-Kelly said it best, “it’s the freaking weekend, baby I’m bout to have me some fun.”
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Novice:</i> Drinking while watching Netflix or the game<br>
				<i>Expert:</i> Being productive with a beer: cleaning, paying bills, emailing or updating your résumé.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Beer shower</b><br>
				Just because you have to shower, doesn’t mean you have to stop drinking. Place your beer on top of easy, accessible objects like your toilet tank or shower rack. If you’re going for the expert approach, buy a beer koozie that attaches to the wall and get your drink on. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Novice:</i> Toilet tank or shower rack<br>
				<i>Expert:</i> Shakoolie

					<p>• House keys</p>
					<p>• Flask ... just in case</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><b>Games</b><br>
				If you’re pre-gaming with a group, spice it up with some activities. Card or board games can easily be turned into drinking games with a little imagination and goal of getting drunk. Games like kings and ride the bus were created for drinking and are a good way to socialize. If you’re the physical type, play a few rounds of beer pong; just don’t kill the vibe by being too competitive.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<h5>To Bar or Not to Bar? That is the question.</h5>
				<p>
				A little capitalism never hurt nobody. Our country is fueled by it.
				</p>
				<p>
				So yes it’s okay to buy a drink if you find yourself losing the buzz, unless you’re at Cleo’s or Dill. Their prices will hurt your pocket and you’ll find yourself spending too much to re-achieve that moment of drunken bliss. If the drinks are calling your name, head to the Chug. Their prices are manageable and won’t feel as bad for dipping into your pizza funds.

					<h2>That bone chilling sound of karaoke</h2>
					<span class="byline">By Drake D'Ambra | 72HRS</span>
						<p>
						The demonic voice resonates throughout The Chug and demands the attention of everyone. The booming sound traces back to the bar’s Jim Beam Stage and begins to make sense. 
						<p>
						It’s karaoke night.
						</p>
						<P>
						The terrifying rendition of Creed’s hit song “Higher” causes everyone in the bar to laugh and take videos. DJ Rob, who runs and operates Kamikaze Karaoke, drops his head in his hands to cover his laughter.
						</P>
						<P>
						Nobody can seem to figure out if the performer is serious or an actual death-metal singer. After the unruly performance, DJ Rob takes over the mic, “Holy shit. That’s one of the funniest things I’ve heard.”
						</p>
						<p>
						Ball State senior Eli Collis performed the everlasting rendition of Higher. His motivation to take the stage and screamo his lungs out came as no surprise.
						</p>
						<p>
						“I’ve been planning this all day because it’s hilarious,” he said. “All I needed was beer.”
						</p>
						<p>
						Collis continued to sing throughout the night and performed three more times. He dropped the demonic singing voice, most notably because his voice started to strain toward the end of Higher. He replaced the voice by bringing beer with him during his later performances.
						</p>
						<p>
						While Collis used liquid courage to get him to the stage, others drew inspiration from more innocent means.
						</p>
						<p>
						Becky Wolfe and Krystal Palmer, Ball State juniors, took the stage sober to perform Journey’s Don’t Stop Believing, which they describe as “our song.” The duo’s reason for performing is simple. “It’s our first time here and we’re in college,” Palmer said. “We had to do it.”

						</div>

						<p>
						Two of the nights other performers, Casey Prins and Amber Griffith, find singing for crowds as second nature. Prins is a junior music major at Ball State, while Griffith, a hairdresser at Hue Salon, has sang her entire life.
						</p>
						<p>
						Even though Prins excels in music, she conceded that her friends urged her to take the mic.
						</p>
						<p>
						These performers drew courage to perform from different means, but they all echoed the main reason for taking the stage boiled down to having fun, which is what DJ Rob said karaoke is all about.
						</p>
						<p>
						“I want people to sing as long as they’re having fun,” he said. “It’s fun when there’s a big group of people having a blast or one guy who’s an amazing singer.”
						</p>
						<p>
						DJ Rob offered advice to people who want to perform.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Pick a song you know,” he said. “It’s going to be the best performance because you won’t have to read each lyric from the screen and it’s not going to be as fun of a performance if you don’t know it.”
						</p>

				<h3>The usual suspects</h3>
						<span class="byline">By Drake D'Ambra | 72HRS</span>
						<p>
						Throughout a Thursday night, karaoke performers aren’t the only people you may come across. In fact, a wide cast of characters are sure to be on the prowl. Since your consumption of alcohol may make you oblivious to your surroundings, here’s a list of some of the people you are missing out on.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Selfie Queens</b> <br>Warning: Your Instagram and Snapchat are about to explode. The reason is none other than the selfie queens. After taking hours to get ready for the night, it’s reasonable to question if they dolled themselves up for social media pictures or to impress those at the bar.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Lone Soldier</b><br>A pint of beer in one hand and eyes fixated on the TV, he’s not here to party or be social. This dude came by himself to watch the big game. The drunken shenanigans don’t faze him, but you better not interfere with him, especially if his team is behind on the scoreboard.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Leech</b><br>No one knows where he came from or when he leeched onto your group, but he’s been hovering around for some time now. He clearly came by himself in search of new friends. Perhaps if he introduced himself it wouldn’t be so bad, but he stands there awkwardly without saying a word. Determined to resolve the situation, you figure out who this guy is or out-awkward him forcing him to leave.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The High-Roller</b><br>Hair slicked back, Burberry dress shirt drapes his shoulders and he’s accessorized with the Rolex. “Lemme get seven shots of tequila,” he tells the bartender as he hands her his credit card. Don’t worry, if you missed out on the first round of shots, he’ll get another round in a few minutes. This bro burns through money like it’s his parents, which makes sense because it is. Regardless, stick with him and let the drinks keep coming.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Hot Couple</b><br>Don’t confuse “hot” with appearance; they’re the couple sitting in the corner, tempers flared and ripping into one another. Nobody knows what sparked the heated argument. In fact, it’s probably nothing other than alcohol. Regardless, it’s not pretty and they’re about to storm out of the bar in 3, 2, 1.
						</p>
						<div class="button">Want something a bit more mature? How to drink like an adult.</div>
						<p>
						<b> Good Girls Club</b><br>Males beware of this group. You have no chance to talk or dance with this lovely group of ladies so don’t even try. They’re fashionable, pretty and the happiest group around, so you can’t blame guys for approaching. The problem is they want a drama free night, which doesn’t exist when males, females and alcohol mix. Better luck next time, guys, and happy hunting.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> That One Guy</b><br>Drinking at The Locker Room, he’s there. Singing karaoke at The Chug, he’s there. Dancing at Dill Street, he’s there. His presence isn’t bad. After all, he’s not that some creepster who stalks you. He’s actually rather cute, and you would entertain a conversation if he approached. The problem is that you see him everywhere when you party, whether it’s Thursday, Saturday or Monday. It doesn’t even matter if you decide to party in downtown Indianapolis. He’ll be there.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Down Goes Frazier</b><br>She started off the night with some subtle dances moves, but they’re not working for her. As she gulps down drink after drink, her confidence grows and she breaks out her risqué dance moves. The problem here isn’t that she’s a bad dancer; she’s wearing heels. Alcohol, fast-paced music and heels never turn out well. The Muhammad Ali KO punch comes when she drops it down low too aggressively. “Down goes Frazier!” and the entire dance floor parts around her. Embarrassing doesn’t begin to describe how she feels.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Negative Nancy</b><br>She’s slouched over with her hand supporting her heavy head as she peers down at her Smartphone. The dance floor, only feet away from her, seems to engulf everyone in the proximity, but not her. Friends check on her, but she shoos them away. Her presence adds only negativity to the night, but she doesn’t seem to care. She would rather sit at the bar and publicly soak in her negativity than resolve the situation.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Energizer Bunny</b><br>This dude is the life of the party from the second he walks in until he exits. It doesn’t matter if he’s on the dance floor or leaving the bathroom, his feet and hips are always in beat with the music. He goes through dance partners like Tony Montana goes through cocaine. The source of his energy isn’t his only mystery. Nobody seems to know who came with because everyone he comes in contact with fails to keep up and gets left behind.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Tiara and Sash</b><br>She just turned 21 and the whole world knows it. The gaudy entrance she makes is complete with tiara and sash. Her first order of business at each bar is to get a free drink from the bartender. A random guy approaches and hooks her up with another drink hoping she reciprocates the hook-up later in the night. After all, birthday sex is a thing. For obvious reasons, she’s belligerent and the dance floor calls. Gentlemen, fixate your eyes on her because the twerk show is here.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Journalist</b><br>He walks into the bar completely out of his element. The Thursday night bar scene is a new concept to him. In fact, his professor is the one who urged him to go for a story. That can’t get any lamer. He tries to blend into the crowd by leaning against a wall, but he sticks out like a sore thumb as he awkwardly jots down notes, interviews people, and takes pictures of videos of the festivities.

				<h2>Carnival dizzies students, sans booze</h2>
						<span class="byline">By Ball State Daily News staff</span>
						<p>
	After scrawling his black marker across the large tablet, Darryl Pyle shakes his drawing hand and leans over to ask the patron how to spell their name, never breaking his smile.
</p>
<p>
	As a caricature artist for the Late Nite Carnival, Pyle was hard at work for the Late Nite&nbsp;event, drawing a long, continuous line of carnival goers. It’s a good thing that Pyle has years of experience.
</p>
<p>
	“I used to work for Disney and Dreamworks animation when I was in my 20s," he said. "I did that for 11 years, and now I do this. But this is a lot of fun, to just show up and draw people.”
</p>
<p>
	The 11th year of the Carnival was packed with students and community members with an estimated 800 students pre-registering alone, said&nbsp;Alicia Fitzgerald, Late Nite adviser.
</p>
<p>
	When the gates opened for general admission at 7 p.m.,&nbsp;more than 200 people were lined up, waiting for their chance to shrug off winter.
</p>
<p>
	Warm, clear weather played a role in attendance — the last few years have been plagued with snow and rain.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the night, it became nearly impossible to walk through the midway without squeezing between a group of friends waiting, often for up to half an hour, to ride one of the many attractions.
</p>
<p>
	When participants grew tired or too queasy to spin, flip and soar on the rides Late Nite offered free games with prizes including hacky sacks and suckers.
</p>
<p>
	For those willing to wager a little money for the chance to take home an overstuffed, large plush character, Poor Jack Amusements offered traditional games, including water gun races.
</p>
<p>
	This year’s event offered a new spectacle, a firework show over LaFollette Complex.
</p>
<p>
	For Pyle, though, the lights and sound are just another day at work.
</p>
<p>
	After seeing an artist working at a theme park, he said he thought it looked fun and tried his hand. It blossomed into a full-time job.
</p>
<p>
	Pyle slides out his latest caricature and hands it to the model, revealing his drawing board covered in names.
</p>
<p>
	“Sometimes, I have people write their names down if they have a unique spelling,” he said.
</p>
<p>
	Pyle gestured to the next guest in line and started on another sketch that will commemorate a treasured night at the Late Nite Carnival.&nbsp;

<h2>The Drunk Parade</h2>
	<p>
	Whether or not you have a name for it, you know what it is. It’s the shambling, shouting, slurring circus that takes to the streets every Friday and Saturday night. Even if you don’t drink, you can’t escape. It winds through campus and pulses through the streets from around nine at night until Mark Carter packs up his hot dog stand.
</p>
<p>
	It’s the Drunk Parade, a ritual of necessity that presumably takes place on every college campus. Born of a need to get somewhere, a pedestrian lifestyle and a BAC over .08, it marches ever onward. And only occasionally in circles.
</p>
<p>
	Business majors Brian Alder, 21, and James Hinton, 22, know the steps well.
</p>
<p>
	“People are friendlier at night,” Alder said. “’Where’s the party at?’ everyone asks. No one ever knows where the party is.”
</p>
<p>
	They explained the culture of meeting new friends on the street. Alder once twisted his ankle whilst returning home from a night of drinking. Unable to walk for long stretches of a time, he was forced to complete his journey a leg at a time. Some passersby noticed his predicament and helped him home.
</p>
<p>
	“At first they thought I was shitfaced because I was sitting on the sidewalk,” he said. “They didn’t ask for everything.”
</p>

<div class="secondarymobile">
	<div class="secondaryquote">
	“’Where’s the party at?’ everyone asks. No one ever knows where the party is.”
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	As for Hinton, when he hits the streets, he’s just looking for a good time.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m just looking for people to party with,” he said. “When I’m drunk, I like to dance.”
</p>
<p>
	High traffic areas are spread out around campus, leading to a degree of reasonable consistency in the crowds in the surrounding areas.
</p>
<p>
	Most densely packed is probably Neely Avenue. It’s a long line of student houses and its proximity to campus make it an easily accessible staging ground for bangers. The fraternity houses draw large numbers to Riverside, like the bars do for W. University.
</p>
<p>
	Group size varies wildly. Some folks go at it alone, while others may find themselves of mobs in excess of 15 people. It’s pretty easy to determine when people don’t have a plan.
</p>
<p>
	In the quiet of nighttime, you can see them walk and argue back and forth. Anyone who has a cell phone can have a lead, but some hikes require more commitment than others. Cross campus walks can lead partiers for miles and if a suitable venue can’t be found, the process of texting, walking and discussing logistics begins again.
</p>
<div class="secondarymobile">
	<div class="secondaryquote">
	“Look at me. Look at me. We’re not crying. Nobody is crying.”
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	With the warm weather, porch drinking has returned. Those with the good fortune to live in a house and bust out the lawn chairs, pop open their poison of choice and observe the parade in its full majesty.
</p>
<p>
	“Look at me. Look at me. We’re not crying. Nobody is crying,” a woman says soothingly to her friend as they struggle to navigate the mangled Neely Avenue sidewalk in heels.
</p>
<p>
	They approach a vehicle and she addresses the driver.
</p>
<p>
	“Tell her we’re not crying. No crying,” she says.
</p>
<p>
	She opens the door and turns to her friend.
</p>
<p>
	“Now get in the f**king car.”<br>

						<h4>Audience favorite Avery Leigh performs final show for Ball State</h4>
						<span class="byline">By Ana Olvera | Ball State Daily News</span>
						
						<p>
	Senior Jaime Whitaker, also known as Avery Leigh, has performed in all of Spectrum’s fall and spring drag shows since 2010. His journey from novice performer to a self-described “queen of curves” culminated in an emotional performance at the Bad to the Bone drag show on Saturday.
</p>
<p>
	For his final performance as a Ball State student, Whitaker chose a routine far different from anything he had ever done before. He switched his upbeat mixes for a ballad and changed from his sequined leotard to a T-shirt and shorts.
</p>
<p>
	The performance created a “clear connection that I am Avery and that I am [also] Jaime,” Whitaker said.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	“It represents something that wasn’t originally in my four-year plan. I never even thought of performing in drag. [But] I believe everything happens for a reason. I wholeheartedly believe that I was meant to become Avery.”&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	His freshman year, Whitaker gave in to his friends’ suggestions and agreed to perform at Spectrum’s 7 Deadly Sins drag show.
</p>
<p>
	“I sort of agreed to it at first, just joking and not really sure if I would go through with it 100 percent,” he said.
</p>

	</div>
</div>
<p>
	The night of his first performance, Whitaker introduced himself to the drag world as Avery Leigh, dancing to Whitney Houston’s “Queen of the Night.”
</p>
<p>
	“Everybody in the audience just went crazy,” Whitaker said. “The reaction that I got when I was performing was something that I have never been able to duplicate. Having that experience firsthand, of just being on stage and having all these people on Ball State’s campus screaming and yelling for you, it was super awesome. And so I did it again, and then I did it again and then I just kept doing it.”
</p>
<p>
	Whitaker is no stranger to the spotlight. He said he performed in his first play when he was in the third or fourth grade and joined show choir in high school.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	“[My high school] had a very competitive show choir and so that got me buckling down into singing and dancing,” Whitaker said. “I feel like all of that sort of paved the way for me to be a drag performer because I do sing live sometimes when I’m in drag. I dance heavily in all of my songs.”
</p>
<p>
	Whitaker kept his two personas separate when he began performing as a drag queen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	“Outside of drag, I never felt good about myself,” Whitaker said. “But Avery, as soon as I created her, she always got compliments.”
</p>
<p>
	Whitaker listened to popular advice from one of his idols and changed his mindset.
</p>
<p>
	“One of my idols, RuPaul, always says that you need to look into the mirror and tell yourself you’re beautiful until you believe it,” Whitaker said, “And so that’s kind of what I did.”

<p>
	He began believing in the connection between his drag queen persona and himself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Whitaker told himself, “You’re Jaime but you’re also Avery. We are the same. So if Avery is beautiful, you’re beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
	“When I did bond my two personalities it was just something that – now it’s official, nothing can hold me back. There’s no mountain I won’t try to climb or river I won’t try to swim across.”
</p>
<p>
	Since his first show in 2010, Whitaker has performed at about 20 shows. He has also recently submitted an audition tape for the reality show RuPaul’s Drag Race.
</p>
<p>
	“[I] never had the intentions of getting into drag and performing,” Whitaker said. “It was just something that happened, and had it not happened I would be a completely different person than I am right now.”
</p>
<p>
	Whitaker plans on moving to California to get a degree in cosmetology, and pursue a career in runway and fashion makeup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	“Regardless of what I do or where I go, I’m always gonna take the skills and the heart that these shows gave me and I’m going to continue to do drag for the benefit of other people,” Whitaker said. “Even though it’s my last show as a Ball State student, I refuse to let this be my last show at Ball State.”

<h3>People you will see at every house party</h3>
</div>
<div class="longform">
<span class="byline">By Saige Driver | 72HRS</span><br>
<p>
	Every college house party is different, yet oddly the same. They are filled with beers, vomit and regret. But, at every house party there are always a couple people you will see. It’s almost universal.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Freshman</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The freshmen are either overdressed, passed out or acting more drunk then they really are. You can pick them out at any party. They tend to travel in packs, bragging about the six-pack of Natty they downed before coming out. And they always have some story about how they ran from the cops back in high school.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Blackouts</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The blackouts are the people with no care in the world. They probably started drinking at noon and are still at it. They’re in their own little wonderful drunken world. They’re ratchet and they know it, and aren’t afraid to show it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Couple Making Out in the Corner</strong>
</p>
<p>
	There isn’t much to say about these people. At every party there will be a couple that desperately needs a room. Ignore them or whatever you’re drinking will come up.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Worrywart</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The worrywarts are the worst kind of people. Sure most the people here are underage and sure we could all get arrested. No big deal right? Wrong. The worrywart will constantly remind everyone the cops could come. They’re too worried about their future to have fun in the present.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Bully</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The bully isn’t someone who is necessarily mean. But, they do know how to bully everyone at the party into drinking more. They will peer pressure you until you take that shot. Might as well just take it now and get it over with.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Competitive Gamers</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Competitive gamers don’t mess around. Drinking games aren’t just a game for them. It’s life. These gamers know all the rules and they will make you follow each and every one. Whether it’s flippy cup, beer pong or quarters it’s serious and they’ll make sure you know it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Philosopher</strong>
</p>
<p>
	These people get real deep. When they’re drunk they don’t cry or pass out, they’ll look into your eyes and see your soul. They ask the real questions, like what if we were all just characters in someone’s dream and none of this is real? Be careful with the philosopher, once a conversation starts, it never ends.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Creeper</strong>
</p>
<p>
	At every party there seems to be that one person who doesn’t get the hint. They’ll ask you to dance, then follow you around the whole night. You’ll find yourself hiding in bathrooms, hiding behind friends, saying your grandma died, pretty much anything to get this person away from you. Please, don’t be this person.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The Crier</strong>
</p>
<p>
	There is always that one girl who is crying. Why? NO ONE KNOWS! She’ll just cry and cry and cry. There is no reasoning with her; she has a lot of things to cry about. Like that one boyfriend who cheated on her a year ago, the girl who looked at her wrong, her drink is gone, just let her cry she has a hard life.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	The DD</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The designated driver is the hero of the night. Though they didn’t willingly choose their sober state, they hold the title with pride. Being the sober person at any event can be a pain when you’re surrounded by drunks, so let’s take a minute to appreciate the sacrifices they made to make sure you don’t end up in a ditch. This one’s for you DD.

					<h2>Coming alive from the church stage</h2>
					<span class="byline">By Emily Theis | 72HRS</span>
				</div>
				<div class="longform">
						<p>
	It’s Sunday morning and I show up at the Horizon Convention center with sleepy eyes and a general idea of the set list that I didn’t really listen to. I say hello to the crew, tinker around with some levels, and flip through Instagram. There’s typically not much energy for our 8 a.m. weekend call. Things are quiet and muffled, especially through the monitors I’ve smashed in my ears. We’re like any group of not-morning-people: only half alive.
</p>
<p>
	“Alright— let’s start. For this first one, let’s have some fun.  Real New Orleans train beat, a Harry Connick Jr. kind of thing. Actually, let me play you this intro on a Marry Chapin Carpenter song I’m thinking of. You’ll get it after that. Hear how dirty it is? Oh, and Emily? Get busy on the piano. Have some fun with the melody. Let’s give it a try. 1,2,3,4."
</p>
<p>
	Sound fills my ears. My fingers move and I find the harmonies, slowly. I look up, and wake up. The more noise we make, the more we find each other, the more we find a little morning life.
</p>
<p>
	This is Commonway Church — we don’t have a building, so we meet in the convention center. Folks get up early to drag in chairs, a stage and instruments to make our little temporary church. I’ve been playing in the band for about a year and a half, most of the time on auxiliary percussion or accordion with some backup vocals. Today I’m on piano, and the five other people on stage with me are my closest companions for the next three hours, because we have a task to complete: leading a few hundred folks in singing to a God none of us understand.

	Church music is a funny thing (that everyone seems to have an opinion about) and there’s a wide range of approaches. You’ve got everything from mega-churches who boast perfectly timed catchy loops and guitars dripping with reverb to the southern simplicity of soulful organ hymns and pure voices, with a drummer stirring a slow snare beat with brushes. Some churches are full-out rock concerts, some barely squeak out shaky acoustic tunes, some are choral phenomena that make your soul break in half.
</p>
<p>
	We’re somewhere in between all the extremes. A few of us are former professional musicians, but most of us are hobbyists. We come from a little bit of everywhere, with all kinds of different tastes and ideas — not to mention personalities. Every Sunday is a new experiment: we’ll turn a ballad into a Weezer-esque anthem. We’ll lead turnarounds with a melodica and autoharp instead of an electric guitar. We’ll totally guess our way through an entire set and end up with a good 20 minutes of worship, or whatever you want to call it. Whatever it is, we make something that we couldn’t have made without each other.
</p>
<p>
	That’s what gets me about it, what keeps me coming back. Walking in, we’re regular sleepy folks with regular sleepy lives. But we’re once playing, catching eyes with each other while we trade solos or blend vocals, discussing how an arrangement should work, making decisions that affect the overall sound — we matter. We have something to contribute. We are somehow more alive.
</p>
<p>
	That’s the way church works for me, as a whole. It isn’t a space or a weekly event. It’s just a bunch of us: human beings coming from vastly different individual lives, dragging in insecurity and confidence in a variety of doses. We have families, problems, fears, deep doubt, devoted belief and  great concern. We are loudly passionate in the present and quietly connected to centuries of worshipers in the past.
</p>
<p>
	Without us, without the people together, there is no church. Nothing is created. It’s just an empty building. We don’t even have a building. But when we find each other in the aisles, on the stage, receiving a message and passing encouragement, we are making something. We remind each other of all those things we all need to hear: You matter. I’m here. I’m scared too. We have hope. Hold on to the good. You are loved.
</p>
<p>
	After we finish playing and pack up, I can ride that connectedness for a while. When I start my Sunday homework with the flood of anxiety that follows me everywhere, I can feel the notes we played hanging in the air, the people I sat next to, the truth the pastor shared. Every week I need that healthy dose of connectedness, those funny New Orleans train beats and  the reminder to come together and to come alive.

					<h2>Best shows to binge watch</h2>
					<span class="byline">By Jeremy Ervin | 72HRS</span>
<p>So it's Sunday and you're just looking for a way to shut your mind off and relax. Try these shows available on Netflix – see if they satisfy your desire for a numb mind.</p>
	<b>1. Trailer Park Boys</b> <i>– 7 seasons – 57 Episodes</i>
<p>
	This documentary style comedy follows the exploits of Julian, Rick and Bubbles as they live their lives of petty crime in a Canadian trailer park. There’s a lot of content to watch and the whole piece is a story from day one.
</p>
<p>
	Many recurring residents of Sunnyvale Trailer make for interesting dynamic and character growth as the story builds upon itself. The chips go up and the chips go down and everything marches on. There are also a couple of movies and new seasons coming.
</p>
	<b>2. Mad Men</b> <i>– 6 Seasons – 78 Episodes</i>
<p>
	Mad Men follows the life of Madison Ave advertising agency Sterling Cooper and the people who pass through its doors. A constant barrage of 60’s chic and Don Draperisms, the personalities in the story drive the action.
</p>
<p>
	Each episode is close to fifty minutes, at seventy-eight episodes, that’s a lot of tv. The amount of total screen time allows even minor characters to develop meaningfully and enjoy their own arcs from time to time.
</p>
	<b>3. That 70’s Show</b> <i>– 8 Seasons</i>
<p>
	A throwback to the pre-internet age, this classic teen sitcom aired from 1998-2005. Previously only available episodically through television, the entire cannon of the show is now available, in order through streaming.
</p>
<p>
	If you’re a fan, it’s a good opportunity to revisit your favorite episodes or start the story from episode one. If you’re new to it, it’s more accessible than ever.
</p>
	<b>4. Adventure Time</b> <i>– 2 Seasons, 50 Episodes</i>
<p>
	This one is a bit more episodic. The short runtime means there are a lot of different episodes, with a lot of different storylines. There’s about 8 hours and 20 minutes of story there, that’ll take up a full sick day.
</p>
<p>
	It follows the adventures of Finn and Jake, the consistency of setup makes it easy to drop into the story at any time. Also, because there’s such a diversity of storylines, the reachability value is high.
</p>
	<b>5. Breaking Bad</b> <i>– 5 Seasons, 62 Episodes</i>
<p>
	Walter White waltzes through the Albuquerque, New Mexico meth-game and beyond. Bryan Cranston redefines himself from his role in “Malcolm in the Middle” and other stars rise as their characters grew over the shows six-year run.
</p>
<p>
	Like mad men, episodes are close to an hour, making for a lot of TV to sit through. The show does a good job of keeping the situations fresh while still adhering to the feel and themes of the show. Because of the involved story, it’s not episodic, so beginning with the pilot episode is probably a good idea.
</p>
	<b>6. Sherlock</b> <i>– 2 Season, 6 Episodes</i>
<p>
	Classic Sherlock Holmes has been updated to work in modern day London. The plots are altered in creative ways to make sense in a current context.
</p>
<p>
	This show really bridges the gap between episodic and overarching story. While there is a running plot, Sherlock’s conflict with his nemesis Moriarty, each story stands alone. Even though there’s only 6 episodes, each is like an hour and half long. So their each like a full length movie.

				<h2>Surviving Sunday's run to the laundromat</h2>
				<span class="byline">By Alicia Kelly | 72HRS</span>
					<p>
	Going to the laundromat is like cleaning out your refrigerator. It's like taking out the trash a few times in a row. It's a chore. If a survey were conducted about the amount of pleasure humans experience while doing laundry, it would be pointless. We know the answer. It sucks. So here I go, once again, packing up my car with smelly socks in the back and a good read in the front passenger.
</p>
<p>
	This Sunday night is the same as all Sunday nights. If only I dreamt of this future before I signed a lease on an apartment that doesn't include a washer and dryer.
</p>
<p>
	Entering the door to the White Spot on Reserve, I realize I didn't bring any quarters. Shit. To the gas station across the street I go to avoid getting $20 back in quarters from the change machine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Okay, back at the White Spot. Time to get to business.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<em>
	Shoves as many clothes in the machine as possible avoiding the warning sign</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Come on, that's all I can fit? Looks like I will be here until tomorrow. Should have brought a sleeping bag.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<em>
	Shoves in quarters and attempts to start the machine with half the amount of quarters required.</em>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Success! Only one row of quarters in and beating the system! In goes the soap. A cap in a half won't hurt right? After all, I wore most of these clothes more than once.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<em>
	Slams lid with a proud smile.</em>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Look at me, I'm such an adult now that my mommy doesn't do my laundry.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Noticing a human that looks close to my age, I work my way to that side of the mat and pop a squat. "Hey, I just found out you don't need to put in two rows of quarters. One works just fine," I mutter.
</p>
<p>
	He lowers the novel from face and smiles. "Yes, I actually found that out a couple years ago, but thanks anyways," he replies. Good job self, now you look like a novice in the art of laundry doing in front of this expert laundry snob.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	I take out some homework and attempt to read through my notes. When I get to the second word, I get bored. Hmm. There are people here. Lots of people. Guess I could people watch. Okay, just kidding, these people don't like when I watch them. I can tell by the way they are telling me to get lost with their eyes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Crap, where's my purse?&nbsp;
</p>
<div class="secondarymobile">
	<div class="secondaryphoto"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.bsd/11115_laundrymat02f.jpg"><br><b>By Rebekah Floyd | 72HRS</b></b></div>
</div>
<p>
	<em>
	Panicky demeanor becomes obvious to the rest of the laundry mat crowd.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>
	Oh okay, I'm wearing it. This place is making me weird..Is my laundry done yet? I walk over to the machine and it's still rumbling, pretty loudly. Did this thing lose its muffler?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<em>Realizes the machine is most likely reacting to the overload of clothes shoved in.</em>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Crap. I need to get my clothes out before this thing explodes. I miraculously turn it off, drag my soaking clothes into the dryer and return to my laundry mat territory breathing heavily. No one told me this was a workout in itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Returning to my area I find trash all over my belongings. Is this a joke? Am I being punished for being an amateur laundry do­er? Whoever did it is gone because now I am the only person in here. Realizing my vulnerability in this situation, I impatiently wait for my clothes to dry and plan my speedy escape.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<em> Shoves halfway dry clothes in basket, throws purse over shoulder and hauls ass to the door.</em>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Holy. Crap. Never. Again. Except next Sunday, and all of the Sundays after that until summer.
