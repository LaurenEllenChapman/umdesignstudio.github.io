				<h2>Drinking on the cheap</h2>
				<span class="byline">By Dominique Stewart | 72HRS</span>
				<p>
				Let’s face it, if you’re reading this you probably fit the typical college student M.O.: broke and loves booze. But that's a horrible combination if you’re trying to get your drink on.
				</p>
				<p>
				When you first turned 21, you probably thought it was OK to spend $20 at the bar, but the money is gone and the bills are stacking up.
				</p>
				<p>
				Forgo drinking at the bars and appreciate the art of the pre-game.
				</p>
				<h5>What is Pre-gaming?</h5>
				<p>
				The term pre-game is synonymous to the show that occurs before a live broadcast of any major sporting event, but it has become a term close to the hearts of many college students.
				</p>
				<p>
				Pre-gaming, as defined by Urban Dictionary, is the act of getting inebriated before going out—to either a party, social event or the bars—regardless if there will be alcohol provided.
				</p>
				<h5>The Art of the Pre-game</h5>
				<p>
				You know how you get when you’re drunk. You start making it rain on the bartender and for what? So you can have that one moment where everyone thinks you’re “the man or woman” for buying them shots? Trust me, you won’t be feeling invincible when AEP cuts your electricity.
				</p>

					<h5>About the booze</h5>
					<p><b>On the cheap:</b> a handle of Jim Bean costs about $20</p>
					<p><b>Oh, you fancy:</b> a handle of Crown Royal costs about $49</p>
					<p><b>At the bars:</b> a shot of whiskey ranges from $7 to $8</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
				<b>Booze Run</b><br>
				You live in a college town. There are liquor stores everywhere. So embrace it and stock up on booze that will last you an entire month.
				</p>
				<p>
				Don’t waste your money on alcohol at the bars. It’s really not worth it. You’ll look like a drunk and that’s not a flattering image, even as a college student.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Bottoms Up</b><br>
				Whether you’re with a group or by yourself, start the night hard. No. I don’t mean take twenty shots of tequila that you become “that guy or gal” who is falling over before you even leave the house. But get yourself to the level you want to be for the rest of the night.
				</p>
				<p>
				If your level is tipsy and flirty or drunk and obnoxious, get there and make it work.
				</p>
				<p>
				The ultimate goal is to reach that level of drunkenness where you can throw your insecurities aside and have the time of your life, while still being able to act sober in front of the cops because ain’t nobody got time for getting a public intoxication ticket.
				</p>
				<p>
				And unless you’re planning on impressing someone by buying him or her a drink, you don’t need to be carrying your wallet. You might end up losing it anyway.
				</p>



				<h5>Ways to Pre-game</h5>
				<p>
				<b>Day drinking</b><br>
				Grab a beer once you get out of your last Friday class. It’s been a hell of a week and baby you deserve it. R-Kelly said it best, “it’s the freaking weekend, baby I’m bout to have me some fun.”
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Novice:</i> Drinking while watching Netflix or the game<br>
				<i>Expert:</i> Being productive with a beer: cleaning, paying bills, emailing or updating your résumé.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Beer shower</b><br>
				Just because you have to shower, doesn’t mean you have to stop drinking. Place your beer on top of easy, accessible objects like your toilet tank or shower rack. If you’re going for the expert approach, buy a beer koozie that attaches to the wall and get your drink on. 
				</p>

					<p>• Flask ... just in case</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><b>Games</b><br>
				If you’re pre-gaming with a group, spice it up with some activities. Card or board games can easily be turned into drinking games with a little imagination and goal of getting drunk. Games like kings and ride the bus were created for drinking and are a good way to socialize. If you’re the physical type, play a few rounds of beer pong; just don’t kill the vibe by being too competitive.
				</p>

				</p>
				<h5>To Bar or Not to Bar? That is the question.</h5>
				<p>
				A little capitalism never hurt nobody. Our country is fueled by it.
				</p>
				<p>
				So yes it’s okay to buy a drink if you find yourself losing the buzz, unless you’re at Cleo’s or Dill. Their prices will hurt your pocket and you’ll find yourself spending too much to re-achieve that moment of drunken bliss. If the drinks are calling your name, head to the Chug. Their prices are manageable and won’t feel as bad for dipping into your pizza funds.

					<h3>That bone chilling sound of karaoke</h3>
					<span class="byline">By Drake D'Ambra | 72HRS</span>
						<p>
						The demonic voice resonates throughout The Chug and demands the attention of everyone. The booming sound traces back to the bar’s Jim Beam Stage and begins to make sense. 
						<p>
						It’s karaoke night.
						</p>
						<P>
						The terrifying rendition of Creed’s hit song “Higher” causes everyone in the bar to laugh and take videos. DJ Rob, who runs and operates Kamikaze Karaoke, drops his head in his hands to cover his laughter.
						</P>
						<P>
						Nobody can seem to figure out if the performer is serious or an actual death-metal singer. After the unruly performance, DJ Rob takes over the mic, “Holy shit. That’s one of the funniest things I’ve heard.”
						</p>
						<p>
						Ball State senior Eli Collis performed the everlasting rendition of Higher. His motivation to take the stage and screamo his lungs out came as no surprise.
						</p>
						<p>
						“I’ve been planning this all day because it’s hilarious,” he said. “All I needed was beer.”
						</p>
						<p>
						Collis continued to sing throughout the night and performed three more times. He dropped the demonic singing voice, most notably because his voice started to strain toward the end of Higher. He replaced the voice by bringing beer with him during his later performances.
						</p>
						<p>
						While Collis used liquid courage to get him to the stage, others drew inspiration from more innocent means.
						</p>
						<p>
						Becky Wolfe and Krystal Palmer, Ball State juniors, took the stage sober to perform Journey’s Don’t Stop Believing, which they describe as “our song.” The duo’s reason for performing is simple. “It’s our first time here and we’re in college,” Palmer said. “We had to do it.”

						</div>

						<p>
						Two of the nights other performers, Casey Prins and Amber Griffith, find singing for crowds as second nature. Prins is a junior music major at Ball State, while Griffith, a hairdresser at Hue Salon, has sang her entire life.
						</p>
						<p>
						Even though Prins excels in music, she conceded that her friends urged her to take the mic.
						</p>
						<p>
						These performers drew courage to perform from different means, but they all echoed the main reason for taking the stage boiled down to having fun, which is what DJ Rob said karaoke is all about.
						</p>
						<p>
						“I want people to sing as long as they’re having fun,” he said. “It’s fun when there’s a big group of people having a blast or one guy who’s an amazing singer.”
						</p>
						<p>
						DJ Rob offered advice to people who want to perform.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Pick a song you know,” he said. “It’s going to be the best performance because you won’t have to read each lyric from the screen and it’s not going to be as fun of a performance if you don’t know it.”
						</p>

				<h3>The usual suspects</h3>
						<span class="byline">By Drake D'Ambra | 72HRS</span>
						<p>
						Throughout a Thursday night, karaoke performers aren’t the only people you may come across. In fact, a wide cast of characters are sure to be on the prowl. Since your consumption of alcohol may make you oblivious to your surroundings, here’s a list of some of the people you are missing out on.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Selfie Queens</b> <br>Warning: Your Instagram and Snapchat are about to explode. The reason is none other than the selfie queens. After taking hours to get ready for the night, it’s reasonable to question if they dolled themselves up for social media pictures or to impress those at the bar.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Lone Soldier</b><br>A pint of beer in one hand and eyes fixated on the TV, he’s not here to party or be social. This dude came by himself to watch the big game. The drunken shenanigans don’t faze him, but you better not interfere with him, especially if his team is behind on the scoreboard.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Leech</b><br>No one knows where he came from or when he leeched onto your group, but he’s been hovering around for some time now. He clearly came by himself in search of new friends. Perhaps if he introduced himself it wouldn’t be so bad, but he stands there awkwardly without saying a word. Determined to resolve the situation, you figure out who this guy is or out-awkward him forcing him to leave.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The High-Roller</b><br>Hair slicked back, Burberry dress shirt drapes his shoulders and he’s accessorized with the Rolex. “Lemme get seven shots of tequila,” he tells the bartender as he hands her his credit card. Don’t worry, if you missed out on the first round of shots, he’ll get another round in a few minutes. This bro burns through money like it’s his parents, which makes sense because it is. Regardless, stick with him and let the drinks keep coming.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Hot Couple</b><br>Don’t confuse “hot” with appearance; they’re the couple sitting in the corner, tempers flared and ripping into one another. Nobody knows what sparked the heated argument. In fact, it’s probably nothing other than alcohol. Regardless, it’s not pretty and they’re about to storm out of the bar in 3, 2, 1.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Good Girls Club</b><br>Males beware of this group. You have no chance to talk or dance with this lovely group of ladies so don’t even try. They’re fashionable, pretty and the happiest group around, so you can’t blame guys for approaching. The problem is they want a drama free night, which doesn’t exist when males, females and alcohol mix. Better luck next time, guys, and happy hunting.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> That One Guy</b><br>Drinking at The Locker Room, he’s there. Singing karaoke at The Chug, he’s there. Dancing at Dill Street, he’s there. His presence isn’t bad. After all, he’s not that some creepster who stalks you. He’s actually rather cute, and you would entertain a conversation if he approached. The problem is that you see him everywhere when you party, whether it’s Thursday, Saturday or Monday. It doesn’t even matter if you decide to party in downtown Indianapolis. He’ll be there.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Down Goes Frazier</b><br>She started off the night with some subtle dances moves, but they’re not working for her. As she gulps down drink after drink, her confidence grows and she breaks out her risqué dance moves. The problem here isn’t that she’s a bad dancer; she’s wearing heels. Alcohol, fast-paced music and heels never turn out well. The Muhammad Ali KO punch comes when she drops it down low too aggressively. “Down goes Frazier!” and the entire dance floor parts around her. Embarrassing doesn’t begin to describe how she feels.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Negative Nancy</b><br>She’s slouched over with her hand supporting her heavy head as she peers down at her Smartphone. The dance floor, only feet away from her, seems to engulf everyone in the proximity, but not her. Friends check on her, but she shoos them away. Her presence adds only negativity to the night, but she doesn’t seem to care. She would rather sit at the bar and publicly soak in her negativity than resolve the situation.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Energizer Bunny</b><br>This dude is the life of the party from the second he walks in until he exits. It doesn’t matter if he’s on the dance floor or leaving the bathroom, his feet and hips are always in beat with the music. He goes through dance partners like Tony Montana goes through cocaine. The source of his energy isn’t his only mystery. Nobody seems to know who came with because everyone he comes in contact with fails to keep up and gets left behind.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Tiara and Sash</b><br>She just turned 21 and the whole world knows it. The gaudy entrance she makes is complete with tiara and sash. Her first order of business at each bar is to get a free drink from the bartender. A random guy approaches and hooks her up with another drink hoping she reciprocates the hook-up later in the night. After all, birthday sex is a thing. For obvious reasons, she’s belligerent and the dance floor calls. Gentlemen, fixate your eyes on her because the twerk show is here.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Journalist</b><br>He walks into the bar completely out of his element. The Thursday night bar scene is a new concept to him. In fact, his professor is the one who urged him to go for a story. That can’t get any lamer. He tries to blend into the crowd by leaning against a wall, but he sticks out like a sore thumb as he awkwardly jots down notes, interviews people, and takes pictures of videos of the festivities.

				<h1>Carnival dizzies students, sans booze</h1>

	After scrawling his black marker across the large tablet, Darryl Pyle shakes his drawing hand and leans over to ask the patron how to spell their name, never breaking his smile.
</p>
<p>
	As a caricature artist for the Late Nite Carnival, Pyle was hard at work for the Late Nite&nbsp;event, drawing a long, continuous line of carnival goers. It’s a good thing that Pyle has years of experience.
</p>
<p>
	“I used to work for Disney and Dreamworks animation when I was in my 20s," he said. "I did that for 11 years, and now I do this. But this is a lot of fun, to just show up and draw people.”
</p>
<p>
	The 11th year of the Carnival was packed with students and community members with an estimated 800 students pre-registering alone, said&nbsp;Alicia Fitzgerald, Late Nite adviser.
</p>
<p>
	When the gates opened for general admission at 7 p.m.,&nbsp;more than 200 people were lined up, waiting for their chance to shrug off winter.
</p>
<p>
	Warm, clear weather played a role in attendance — the last few years have been plagued with snow and rain.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the night, it became nearly impossible to walk through the midway without squeezing between a group of friends waiting, often for up to half an hour, to ride one of the many attractions.
</p>
<p>
	When participants grew tired or too queasy to spin, flip and soar on the rides Late Nite offered free games with prizes including hacky sacks and suckers.
</p>
<p>
	For those willing to wager a little money for the chance to take home an overstuffed, large plush character, Poor Jack Amusements offered traditional games, including water gun races.
</p>
<p>
	This year’s event offered a new spectacle, a firework show over LaFollette Complex.
</p>
<p>
	For Pyle, though, the lights and sound are just another day at work.
</p>
<p>
	After seeing an artist working at a theme park, he said he thought it looked fun and tried his hand. It blossomed into a full-time job.
</p>
<p>
	Pyle slides out his latest caricature and hands it to the model, revealing his drawing board covered in names.
</p>
<p>
	“Sometimes, I have people write their names down if they have a unique spelling,” he said.
</p>
<p>
	Pyle gestured to the next guest in line and started on another sketch that will commemorate a treasured night at the Late Nite Carnival.&nbsp;

<h2>The march of the Drunk Parade</h2>
	<p>
	Whether or not you have a name for it, you know what it is. It’s the shambling, shouting, slurring circus that takes to the streets every Friday and Saturday night. Even if you don’t drink, you can’t escape. It winds through campus and pulses through the streets from around nine at night until Mark Carter packs up his hot dog stand.
</p>
<p>
	It’s the Drunk Parade, a ritual of necessity that presumably takes place on every college campus. Born of a need to get somewhere, a pedestrian lifestyle and a BAC over .08, it marches ever onward. And only occasionally in circles.
</p>
<p>
	Business majors Brian Alder, 21, and James Hinton, 22, know the steps well.
</p>
<p>
	“People are friendlier at night,” Alder said. “’Where’s the party at?’ everyone asks. No one ever knows where the party is.”
</p>
<p>
	They explained the culture of meeting new friends on the street. Alder once twisted his ankle whilst returning home from a night of drinking. Unable to walk for long stretches of a time, he was forced to complete his journey a leg at a time. Some passersby noticed his predicament and helped him home.
</p>
<p>
	“At first they thought I was shitfaced because I was sitting on the sidewalk,” he said. “They didn’t ask for everything.”
</p>
<p>
	As for Hinton, when he hits the streets, he’s just looking for a good time.
</p>
<p>
	“I’m just looking for people to party with,” he said. “When I’m drunk, I like to dance.”
</p>
<p>
	High traffic areas are spread out around campus, leading to a degree of reasonable consistency in the crowds in the surrounding areas.
</p>
<p>
	Most densely packed is probably Neely Avenue. It’s a long line of student houses and its proximity to campus make it an easily accessible staging ground for bangers. The fraternity houses draw large numbers to Riverside, like the bars do for W. University.
</p>
<p>
	Group size varies wildly. Some folks go at it alone, while others may find themselves of mobs in excess of 15 people. It’s pretty easy to determine when people don’t have a plan.
</p>
<p>
	In the quiet of nighttime, you can see them walk and argue back and forth. Anyone who has a cell phone can have a lead, but some hikes require more commitment than others. Cross campus walks can lead partiers for miles and if a suitable venue can’t be found, the process of texting, walking and discussing logistics begins again.
</p>
<p>
	With the warm weather, porch drinking has returned. Those with the good fortune to live in a house and bust out the lawn chairs, pop open their poison of choice and observe the parade in its full majesty.
</p>
<p>
	“Look at me. Look at me. We’re not crying. Nobody is crying,” a woman says soothingly to her friend as they struggle to navigate the mangled Neely Avenue sidewalk in heels.
</p>
<p>
	They approach a vehicle and she addresses the driver.
</p>
<p>
	“Tell her we’re not crying. No crying,” she says.
</p>
<p>
	She opens the door and turns to her friend.
</p>
<p>
	“Now get in the f**king car.”
