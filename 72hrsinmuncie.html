				<h2>Drinking on the cheap</h2>
				<span class="byline">By Dominique Stewart | 72HRS</span>
				<p>
				Let’s face it, if you’re reading this you probably fit the typical college student M.O.: broke and loves booze. But that's a horrible combination if you’re trying to get your drink on.
				</p>
				<p>
				When you first turned 21, you probably thought it was OK to spend $20 at the bar, but the money is gone and the bills are stacking up.
				</p>
				<p>
				Forgo drinking at the bars and appreciate the art of the pre-game.
				</p>
				<h5>What is Pre-gaming?</h5>
				<p>
				The term pre-game is synonymous to the show that occurs before a live broadcast of any major sporting event, but it has become a term close to the hearts of many college students.
				</p>
				<p>
				Pre-gaming, as defined by Urban Dictionary, is the act of getting inebriated before going out—to either a party, social event or the bars—regardless if there will be alcohol provided.
				</p>
				<h5>The Art of the Pre-game</h5>
				<p>
				You know how you get when you’re drunk. You start making it rain on the bartender and for what? So you can have that one moment where everyone thinks you’re “the man or woman” for buying them shots? Trust me, you won’t be feeling invincible when AEP cuts your electricity.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Booze Run</b><br>
				You live in a college town. There are liquor stores everywhere. So embrace it and stock up on booze that will last you an entire month.
				</p>
				<p>
				Don’t waste your money on alcohol at the bars. It’s really not worth it. You’ll look like a drunk and that’s not a flattering image, even as a college student.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Bottoms Up</b><br>
				Whether you’re with a group or by yourself, start the night hard. No. I don’t mean take twenty shots of tequila that you become “that guy or gal” who is falling over before you even leave the house. But get yourself to the level you want to be for the rest of the night.
				</p>
				<p>
				If your level is tipsy and flirty or drunk and obnoxious, get there and make it work.
				</p>
				<p>
				The ultimate goal is to reach that level of drunkenness where you can throw your insecurities aside and have the time of your life, while still being able to act sober in front of the cops because ain’t nobody got time for getting a public intoxication ticket.
				</p>
				<p>
				And unless you’re planning on impressing someone by buying him or her a drink, you don’t need to be carrying your wallet. You might end up losing it anyway.
				</p>

					<h5>About the booze</h5>
					<p><b>On the cheap:</b> a handle of Jim Bean costs about $20</p>
					<p><b>Oh, you fancy:</b> a handle of Crown Royal costs about $49</p>
					<p><b>At the bars:</b> a shot of whiskey ranges from $7 to $8</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h5>Ways to Pre-game</h5>
				<p>
				<b>Day drinking</b><br>
				Grab a beer once you get out of your last Friday class. It’s been a hell of a week and baby you deserve it. R-Kelly said it best, “it’s the freaking weekend, baby I’m bout to have me some fun.”
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Novice:</i> Drinking while watching Netflix or the game<br>
				<i>Expert:</i> Being productive with a beer: cleaning, paying bills, emailing or updating your résumé.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Beer shower</b><br>
				Just because you have to shower, doesn’t mean you have to stop drinking. Place your beer on top of easy, accessible objects like your toilet tank or shower rack. If you’re going for the expert approach, buy a beer koozie that attaches to the wall and get your drink on. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Novice:</i> Toilet tank or shower rack<br>
				<i>Expert:</i> Shakoolie
				</p>
				<p><b>Games</b><br>
				If you’re pre-gaming with a group, spice it up with some activities. Card or board games can easily be turned into drinking games with a little imagination and goal of getting drunk. Games like kings and ride the bus were created for drinking and are a good way to socialize. If you’re the physical type, play a few rounds of beer pong; just don’t kill the vibe by being too competitive.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Novice:</i> Beer pong<br>
				<i>Expert:</i> Edward 40 hands
				</p>
				<h5>To Bar or Not to Bar? That is the question.</h5>
				<p>
				A little capitalism never hurt nobody. Our country is fueled by it.
				</p>
				<p>
				So yes it’s okay to buy a drink if you find yourself losing the buzz, unless you’re at Cleo’s or Dill. Their prices will hurt your pocket and you’ll find yourself spending too much to re-achieve that moment of drunken bliss. If the drinks are calling your name, head to the Chug. Their prices are manageable and won’t feel as bad for dipping into your pizza funds.

					<h3>That bone chilling sound of karaoke</h3>
					<span class="byline">By Drake D'Ambra | 72HRS</span>
						<p>
						The demonic voice resonates throughout The Chug and demands the attention of everyone. The booming sound traces back to the bar’s Jim Beam Stage and begins to make sense. 
						<p>
						It’s karaoke night.
						</p>
						<P>
						The terrifying rendition of Creed’s hit song “Higher” causes everyone in the bar to laugh and take videos. DJ Rob, who runs and operates Kamikaze Karaoke, drops his head in his hands to cover his laughter.
						</P>
						<P>
						Nobody can seem to figure out if the performer is serious or an actual death-metal singer. After the unruly performance, DJ Rob takes over the mic, “Holy shit. That’s one of the funniest things I’ve heard.”
						</p>
						<p>
						Ball State senior Eli Collis performed the everlasting rendition of Higher. His motivation to take the stage and screamo his lungs out came as no surprise.
						</p>
						<p>
						“I’ve been planning this all day because it’s hilarious,” he said. “All I needed was beer.”
						</p>
						<p>
						Collis continued to sing throughout the night and performed three more times. He dropped the demonic singing voice, most notably because his voice started to strain toward the end of Higher. He replaced the voice by bringing beer with him during his later performances.
						</p>
						<p>
						While Collis used liquid courage to get him to the stage, others drew inspiration from more innocent means.
						</p>
						<p>
						Becky Wolfe and Krystal Palmer, Ball State juniors, took the stage sober to perform Journey’s Don’t Stop Believing, which they describe as “our song.” The duo’s reason for performing is simple. “It’s our first time here and we’re in college,” Palmer said. “We had to do it.”
						</p>

						<p>
						Two of the nights other performers, Casey Prins and Amber Griffith, find singing for crowds as second nature. Prins is a junior music major at Ball State, while Griffith, a hairdresser at Hue Salon, has sang her entire life.
						</p>
						<p>
						Even though Prins excels in music, she conceded that her friends urged her to take the mic.
						</p>
						<p>
						These performers drew courage to perform from different means, but they all echoed the main reason for taking the stage boiled down to having fun, which is what DJ Rob said karaoke is all about.
						</p>
						<p>
						“I want people to sing as long as they’re having fun,” he said. “It’s fun when there’s a big group of people having a blast or one guy who’s an amazing singer.”
						</p>
						<p>
						DJ Rob offered advice to people who want to perform.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Pick a song you know,” he said. “It’s going to be the best performance because you won’t have to read each lyric from the screen and it’s not going to be as fun of a performance if you don’t know it.”
						</p>

				<h3>The usual suspects</h3>
						<span class="byline">By Drake D'Ambra | 72HRS</span>
						<p>
						Throughout a Thursday night, karaoke performers aren’t the only people you may come across. In fact, a wide cast of characters are sure to be on the prowl. Since your consumption of alcohol may make you oblivious to your surroundings, here’s a list of some of the people you are missing out on.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Selfie Queens</b> <br>Warning: Your Instagram and Snapchat are about to explode. The reason is none other than the selfie queens. After taking hours to get ready for the night, it’s reasonable to question if they dolled themselves up for social media pictures or to impress those at the bar.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Lone Soldier</b><br>A pint of beer in one hand and eyes fixated on the TV, he’s not here to party or be social. This dude came by himself to watch the big game. The drunken shenanigans don’t faze him, but you better not interfere with him, especially if his team is behind on the scoreboard.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Leech</b><br>No one knows where he came from or when he leeched onto your group, but he’s been hovering around for some time now. He clearly came by himself in search of new friends. Perhaps if he introduced himself it wouldn’t be so bad, but he stands there awkwardly without saying a word. Determined to resolve the situation, you figure out who this guy is or out-awkward him forcing him to leave.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The High-Roller</b><br>Hair slicked back, Burberry dress shirt drapes his shoulders and he’s accessorized with the Rolex. “Lemme get seven shots of tequila,” he tells the bartender as he hands her his credit card. Don’t worry, if you missed out on the first round of shots, he’ll get another round in a few minutes. This bro burns through money like it’s his parents, which makes sense because it is. Regardless, stick with him and let the drinks keep coming.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Hot Couple</b><br>Don’t confuse “hot” with appearance; they’re the couple sitting in the corner, tempers flared and ripping into one another. Nobody knows what sparked the heated argument. In fact, it’s probably nothing other than alcohol. Regardless, it’s not pretty and they’re about to storm out of the bar in 3, 2, 1.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Good Girls Club</b><br>Males beware of this group. You have no chance to talk or dance with this lovely group of ladies so don’t even try. They’re fashionable, pretty and the happiest group around, so you can’t blame guys for approaching. The problem is they want a drama free night, which doesn’t exist when males, females and alcohol mix. Better luck next time, guys, and happy hunting.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> That One Guy</b><br>Drinking at The Locker Room, he’s there. Singing karaoke at The Chug, he’s there. Dancing at Dill Street, he’s there. His presence isn’t bad. After all, he’s not that some creepster who stalks you. He’s actually rather cute, and you would entertain a conversation if he approached. The problem is that you see him everywhere when you party, whether it’s Thursday, Saturday or Monday. It doesn’t even matter if you decide to party in downtown Indianapolis. He’ll be there.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Down Goes Frazier</b><br>She started off the night with some subtle dances moves, but they’re not working for her. As she gulps down drink after drink, her confidence grows and she breaks out her risqué dance moves. The problem here isn’t that she’s a bad dancer; she’s wearing heels. Alcohol, fast-paced music and heels never turn out well. The Muhammad Ali KO punch comes when she drops it down low too aggressively. “Down goes Frazier!” and the entire dance floor parts around her. Embarrassing doesn’t begin to describe how she feels.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Negative Nancy</b><br>She’s slouched over with her hand supporting her heavy head as she peers down at her Smartphone. The dance floor, only feet away from her, seems to engulf everyone in the proximity, but not her. Friends check on her, but she shoos them away. Her presence adds only negativity to the night, but she doesn’t seem to care. She would rather sit at the bar and publicly soak in her negativity than resolve the situation.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Energizer Bunny</b><br>This dude is the life of the party from the second he walks in until he exits. It doesn’t matter if he’s on the dance floor or leaving the bathroom, his feet and hips are always in beat with the music. He goes through dance partners like Tony Montana goes through cocaine. The source of his energy isn’t his only mystery. Nobody seems to know who came with because everyone he comes in contact with fails to keep up and gets left behind.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> Tiara and Sash</b><br>She just turned 21 and the whole world knows it. The gaudy entrance she makes is complete with tiara and sash. Her first order of business at each bar is to get a free drink from the bartender. A random guy approaches and hooks her up with another drink hoping she reciprocates the hook-up later in the night. After all, birthday sex is a thing. For obvious reasons, she’s belligerent and the dance floor calls. Gentlemen, fixate your eyes on her because the twerk show is here.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b> The Journalist</b><br>He walks into the bar completely out of his element. The Thursday night bar scene is a new concept to him. In fact, his professor is the one who urged him to go for a story. That can’t get any lamer. He tries to blend into the crowd by leaning against a wall, but he sticks out like a sore thumb as he awkwardly jots down notes, interviews people, and takes pictures of videos of the festivities.
